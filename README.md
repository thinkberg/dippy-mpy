# ESP32 w/ LED Matrix

- ESP32 board (joy-it)
- Simple 64x64 LED matrix

This code requires a modified micropython with the
added [ledmatrix library](https://github.com/Winkelkatze/ledmatrix).
The compilation is not straightforward as it uses a modified
I2S implementation that is a bit out of date.
